5.0,Yes,Great value,"These are great!  Way better than using rubber bands or zip ties for cords.

5.0,Yes,Amazingly handy for a lot more than you would imagine...,"I got this velcro in order to attach my hard drive, and external usb wifi card to the lid of my laptop, as I have done many times before with this very product. It has amazing adhesive properties and has yet to come unstuck from the laptop surface even with the moderate heat of the LCD itself. I make sure to clean the spot where I intend to apply this velcro intensly and I attribute this in addition to the adhesive itself for my experience. The actual velcro connection between the hook and loop sides is very strong, so much so that I always have to keep pressure on the laptop surface to remove either the drive or wifi adapter.

5.0,Yes,Velcro to the rescue,"I bought this adorable cross-body purse, and loved the little compartments it had.. snaps in two areas.  Barely one month later, one of the snaps breaks off.  It's leather, so sewing was out of the question... the snaps tore out of the purse, so glue wasn't an option.. Then I thought of velcro.  I bought this, clipped the velcro to fit, and I was happy again... Until the other snap broke.  But no worries -- I had more velcro!  I did the same again, and now I'm happy again... and since there are no more snaps to break off this purse, I should be fine for quite a while.Very handy to have this on hand for other similar emergency repairs.",http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1WWJC3Q1PGX4J,0,0,No,332,0,"July 15, 2014",http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13CBAVZ5VT9RV?ASIN=B000TGSPV6,0
1.0,Yes,The worst adhesive velcro ever made on the planet.,"This brand of velcro with adhesive backs is probably the most epically terrible product of this type ever made. First, they don't stick, and even if they did, when one were to rip them apart as one wants to separate the velcro you couldn't because it would tear off of whatever you had stuck either side on. Seriously, I thought maybe I needed to wet the sides like a glue to instantiate them or something, but they're like damp cigarettes, just limply dangling, totally, utterly worthless. I can think of many other better ways to throw away a few bucks, like a 12 ounce can of beer, maybe? Just pathetic.",http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2UQMJ0R5P06FT,0,0,No,332,0,"January 11, 2015",http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XWN2WKAAZQQI?ASIN=B000TGSPV6,0

There are 4 sets of Velcro strips included in the order that I spaced evenly onto the back of my item and then pressed it up against the tile.

5.0,Yes,Gets the job done.,"The Velcro works great. Sticks perfectly fine, easy to take on and off whatever item you decide to use it with. Don't understand what certain people expected this to hold that they've had problems with and in the instructions, it clearly says not recommended for use in your car's dashboard.

4.0,Yes,Very Good and Very Sticky Adhesive,"While these are very good quality, I realized after purchasing these that I could have bought the equivalent in Dollar General for only two dollars.  Other than being double priced, these are good quality. I used them on my lawn mower tractor seat to keep me from sliding off the slick seat when mowing on an incline. I only used the rough side on my seat so it would catch against my pants.
